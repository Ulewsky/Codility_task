# Codility_task
There is 2 different types of programs in this Repository:
- First of them are 2 tasks from my Codility exam which was first step in recruitment,
- Second one are two programs which are solutions for example tasks on Codility website

## Task 1
Write a function:
```python
  def solution(A)
```
that given an array A of N integers , returns the sum of the largest odd integer and the largest even integer in A. If there are no odd or no even integers in A, you can assume that the largest one is the corresponding group is 0.
Examples:
1. Given A = [5,3,10,6,11], the function should return 21. The largest odd integer is 11 and the largest even integer is 10, so their sum is 11 + 10 = 21.
2. Given A = [2,6,4,6], the function should return 6. The largest even integer is 6. As there are no odd integers in the array, we assume the largest of them is 0.

### Task 2
An online shop sells T-shirts of three sizes: S(small), M(medium) and L(large).
Write a function ```solution(T)``` that given a string T of length N containing letters S,M and L returns a sorted string T by T-shirt sizes from the smallest to the largest.
Examples:
1. Given T = "MSSLS", the function should return "SSSML".
2. Given T = "LLMS", the function should return "SMLL".

#### Swap function
Function swap values in a vector by k places.
##### N_chain function
User can input a natural number and the function will create list from 0 to n.
